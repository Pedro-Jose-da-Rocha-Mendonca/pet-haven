        question: "How do I know which type of pet is right for me?",
        answer: "Consider your activity level, living situation, allergies, and experience with pets."
      },
      {
        question: "What are the benefits of adopting rather than buying a pet?",
        answer: "Saving a life, reducing overpopulation, and often receiving a pet that's already vaccinated and spayed/neutered."
      }
    ],
    "Adoption Process": [
      {
        question: "What is the typical adoption process?",

      },
      {
        question: "What questions will the shelter or rescue ask me?",
        answer: "About your lifestyle, home environment, previous pet experience, and how you'll care for the pet."
      },
      {
        question: "What is the adoption fee, and what does it cover?",
        answer: "Fees vary but often include vaccinations, spaying/neutering, microchipping, and sometimes a starter kit."
      }
    ],
    "Pet Care": [
      {
        question: "What kind of care will the pet need?",

      },
      {
        question: "How do I prepare my home for a new pet?",
        answer: "Secure unsafe areas, provide appropriate bedding, food/water bowls, toys, and a designated space for the pet."
      },
      {
        question: "What supplies do I need to have before bringing my pet home?",
        answer: "Food, a leash/harness (for dogs), litter and litter box (for cats), toys, a bed, and grooming tools."
      }
    ],
    "Health and Behavior": [
      {
        question: "Will the pet have any health or behavioral issues?",
        answer: "Shelters often disclose known issues, but ask about the pet's history and temperament."
      },
      {
        question: "What should I do if my adopted pet has trouble adjusting?",
        answer: "Be patient, give them space, maintain a routine, and consider consulting a trainer or veterinarian."
      },
      {
        question: "How do I introduce the new pet to my other pets?",
        answer: "Slowly and in neutral territory if possible, while supervising interactions closely."
      }
    ],
    "Post-Adoption": [
      {
        question: "Can I return the pet if it doesn't work out?",
        answer: "Most shelters have a return policy, but it's important to confirm this before adopting."
      },
      {
        question: "What resources are available to help me with training or care?",
        answer: "Shelters often provide post-adoption support, and there are many local trainers and online resources."
      },
      {
        question: "How long does it take for a pet to adjust to a new home?",
        answer: "It varies, but generally 3 days to decompress, 3 weeks to learn the routine, and 3 months to fully settle."
